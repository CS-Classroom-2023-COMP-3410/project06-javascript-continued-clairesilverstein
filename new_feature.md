The new feature I attempted to add was a way to use teh drag and drop function of the tasks to nest certain tasks below others to create a hierarchy of tasks. When shift was held down, the task being dragged was supposed to nest under the task it was being placed below. This is a reasonable request because the drag and drop functionality already worked from the previous project. Also, chat was able to nest the tasks it just did not do it correctly. This way, I knew it was possible to nest the tasks, chat just could not get the tasks nested correctly. Chat could only have the tasks each nest one below eachother instead of having an individual task nest. So the tasks just looked like a staircase which does not implement the hierarchy I was going for.
